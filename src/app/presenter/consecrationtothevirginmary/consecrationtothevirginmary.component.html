    <h4>Consecration to the Virgin Mary</h4>
    <p>
        My Queen and my Mother, I give myself entirely to you; <br>
        And to show my devotion to you, <br>
        I consecrate to you this day my eyes, my ears, my mouth, my heart, <br>
        My whole being without reserve. <br>
        Wherefore, good Mother, as I am your own, <br>
        Keep me, guard me, as your property and possession. Amen. <br>

    </p>
