        Our Father, who art in heaven, <br>
        hallowed be thy name. <br>
        Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, <br>
        on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day <br>
        our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses <br>
        as we forgive those who trespassed against us; <br>
        and lead us not into temptation,<br>
        but deliver us from evil. Amen
    </p>
