    <h4>Prayer of St. Gertrude The Great</h4>
    <p>
        Eternal Father, I offer You the most precious blood of
        Thy Divine Son, Jesus Christ, in union with the Masses said
        throughout the world today, for all the Holy Souls in
        Purgatory, for sinners everywhere, for sinners
        in the universal church, and for those
        in my own home. Amen.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>MARANATHA: </strong> Jesus come, come for us.
