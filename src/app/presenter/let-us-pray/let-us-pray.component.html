    O God, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death and resurrection, has purchased for us the
    rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech you, that meditating on these mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of
    the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ
    our Lord. Amen.
