    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
        Saint Michael, the archangel, defend us in battle; be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the
        devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; and do thou O Prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God,
        thrust into hell Satan and the other evil spirits who prowl around the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.
