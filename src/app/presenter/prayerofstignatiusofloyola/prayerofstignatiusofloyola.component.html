    <h4>Prayer of St. Ignatius of Loyola </h4>
    <p>
        Take O Lord, and receive all my liberty, <br> 
        my understanding and my whole will. <br>
        All that I am, all that I possess You have given me. <br>
        I surrender it all to You to be disposed of according to Your will. <br>
        Give me only Your love and Your grace; <br>
        with these I will be rich enough, <br>
        and will desire nothing more.

    </p>
